     #
          Any input line whose first non-whitespace character is a
          hash (#) is ignored as a comment.  This means that no key
          can begin with a hash.  An empty line or a line consisting
          of nothing but white space is ignored.

     key
          A line consisting of at least one non-whitespace character
          and no equal sign causes the key and value pair to be
          printed.  If not found, the message
               key: key not found
          is printed.  Note that the characters in italics are not
          printed exactly.  The actual key is printed.  This message
          is printed to cout.

     key =
          If there is only whitespace after the equal sign, the key
          and value pair is deleted from the map.

     key = value
          If the key is found in the map, its value field is replaced
          by the new value.  If not found, the key and value are
          inserted in increasing lexicographic order, sorted by key.
          The new key and value pair is printed.

     =
          All of the key and value pairs in the map are printed in
          lexicographic order.

     = value
          All of the key and value pairs with the given value are
          printed in lexicographic order sorted by key.
