Even though Le Jour Se Lève (1939), Daybreak in english, and Sin City (2005) were made 66 years apart, the themes, motifs, and characters could be regarded as one in the same. Le Jour Se Lève deals with François deciding what to do after killing M. Valentin in his apartment. M. Valentin was jealous of François because François fell in love with another woman that Valentin wanted. Sin City tells the tale of three interlocking stories all dealing with a man, be it Marv, Dwight, or Hartigan, trying to save a woman, but in the end dies from his own decisions except for Dwight, who kills Jackie Boy and Manute to save the women of Old Town. In each of these three stories, they all have qualities that  Le Jour Se Lève contains. This leads to the question, "Is there something ‘neo’ about neo-noir?"
Marv’s story in Sin City is about him trying to figure out who had killed the hooker, whom he fell in love with and slept with that night, killing anyone in his path, but in the end dies from being framed for the murder of her. The basic storyline being, a man dies from falling in love with the wrong woman, a femme fatale. This is in all film noirs including  Le Jour Se Lève. It is when François falls in love with Françoise that leads to his demise starting at the beginning of the film. Marv is framed from the beginning of the film for the death of Goldie. Knowing all too well that this was a set up, he decides to go and find the actual murderer and by doing so he is caught and is put into the electric chair to die. 
The two films  are similar in the fact that in falling in love with Françoise and Goldie, the man that does so dies. In film noir these femme fatales are there to provide a meaning to the main characters life. Both Marv and François want to marry the femme fatale but are unable. This goes to show that neo-noir and film noir are essentially the same when it comes to the femme fatale and how they lead to the death of their man.
Dwight’s story deals with him trying to cover up the death of a corrupt cop so that the cops won’t lash out on the prostitute gang. In Le Jour Se Lève this corresponds to François’ interactions with M. Valentin meaning that M. Valentin deceives François so that he can have Françoise to himself.
The final story within Sin City is John Hartigan’s struggle to keep Rourke Jr., a sexual predator, away from Nancy Callahan. Through all of this there is a internal monologue from Hartigan in the form of a voice over that details his actions. This coincides with François’ internal struggle throughout the whole movie.
