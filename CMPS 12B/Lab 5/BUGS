lines error                                                      how it was fixed
11    head wasnt constructed properly                            allocated memory for it
15-16 node is constructed incorrectly                            allocated memory for it
22-29 variables not constructed properly                         changed variables to pointers, allocated memory and corrected syntax   
34    needed temp variable to fix issue                          added temp node and set it to head->next and ended up with temp->next 
                                                                 instead of head->next->next
39    node is not freed after removing it                        unallocated nodes memory
57-59 only freed memory of head node none of the rest though     rewrote function to unallocate all of memory used
